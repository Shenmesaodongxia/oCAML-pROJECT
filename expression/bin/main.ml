   (* An improved function to parse everything from a 'channel'.
    * It has a side-effect (namely: reads from an input-channel)
    * The filename is passed for error-reporting purposes only
    * 
    * To make developing a parser easier, this function reports
    * a location of the parse error.
    * We're using the lexer to determine the location, and the
    * location of the error will be the last lexed token.
    * This means that the error is an approximate indication,
    * but it's better than nothing, and it doesn't require anything
    * with respect to the grammar.
    * However, it does require some discipline from the lexer:
    * Make sure to add 'Lexing.new_line lexbuf;' for every newline
    * that is, my 'token' lexer reads:
    *   | newline { Lexing.new_line lexbuf;token lexbuf }
    * and my 'comment' lexer reads:
    *   | newline { Lexing.new_line lexbuf;comment level lexbuf }
    * (this is placed just before the parsing of _)
    * If you don't call newline, you'll still get a location,
    * but it count newlines as characters all of a sudden.
    * This means things behave as if the entire file is a single line.
    * If that's how you've written your lexer, and you can't be bothered
    * to change your lexer, the work-around is to remove all newlines
    * from the input file to get an error location.
